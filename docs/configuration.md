### Configuration
OpenAudioMc makes a subdirectory named after the plugin (`plugins/openaudiomc`) and makes two files, a `config.yml` and `data.yml`.

- `config.yml` Contains all your in-game configuration options. Every option is described in the file itself. Please only make changes to this file since it may be overwritten otherwise.
- `data.yml` Contains data unique to your server, stored by the plugin to keep track of settings and accounts. Please never change this file manually and never share its contents with anyone else since it contains credentials unique to your server.

Additional configuration options (web-client customization, addons, and more) can be done through a [craftmend account](account.md)
